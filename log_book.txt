Day 1: 
	- I've created the project using the command "ng new perfect-memory-project" (note that I've say Yes to the Angular rooting prompt and I'm using CSS )
	- Next, Using the command "ng generate component Movie", I've created a new component
	- Inside this component, I fetch the api using the movie id ( which is passed as a parameter ) 
	- Next, I've created an list where I store the names and the ids of 10 movies and display them as a list.
	- I choose to create an new component to show the complete information of a movie, which is showed on click with a boolean. 
Day 2:
	- I've create a filter pipe to make possible the searching of a specified movie in the list with his name
	- Next I've choose to create a new page , where an user can search for a movie with his name.
  - But I realize really fast that the new page was useless, so I put the searching engine on the same page
Day 3:
  - Let's add some CSS ! 
  - Add a new property for the "movies" called date to permit the creation of a filter by date
  - Search engine is up but I have a wierd bug , the movie list don't update , I have to filter the list by name and by hand with a random string to update it to the user
  - Next I've change the name of the filter pipe and create a new one for the year, I'll figured out later for the bug on the update
  - Now that I've add the filter by year, the work is done but the bug for the list still remain, let's put our mind on ! Note for later, add comments on the code.
Day 4:
  - Not a very happy day, after one day at trying to solve this bug I've give up, it's maybe due to a way that I haven't cross or my lack of knowledge of the angular framework..
  - Nevermind, I add some comments and change a little bit the css.

The work is finish now and I'm proud of me, it's not perfect but it's working and it's reflet my work and my way to code. 
The subject was very interesting and makes me grow. The biggest point to learn was the angular framework, that I had the opportunity to try only when I was working on the ionic framework.
